Pixel Painter

A creative game built with Python and Pygame where you control a paintbrush to cover the screen with colorful trails while avoiding obstacles that chase you. Paint as much as you can before time runs out or you lose all your health!

Install Pygame by running pip install pygame in your terminal.

How to Play
Run the pixel_painter.py file using Python.
Use the Arrow Keys to move your paintbrush (colored square) around the screen.

Your score is based on how much of the screen you paint.
